# PoissonSurfaceReconstruction_MATLAB-Version

This repo includes Poisson Surface Reconstruction code in MATLAB mostly. For the MarchingCubes function, we used Python skimage package.

# Usage
Download data from the following link, Unzip it into the code folder, so that all data should be stored in"PoissonSurfaceReconstruction_MATLAB-Version/Data", and the code should run, no other changes required.

# Requirements
For Matlab code, Matlab2019A or whatever version.

For Marching Cubes, Visualization, and Uniformly sampling oriented points from a PLY file, need to create a Conda environment or Virtual environment of Python3 and install the following libraries.

Numpy

Scipy

Skimage

Trimesh

Open3D
